# Tic Tac Toe - Rolling Moves Edition 🎮

This is a custom implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in C#, where each player can only have up to **3 active marks** on the board. Once a player makes their **fourth move**, the **oldest mark is removed**, keeping the gameplay dynamic and strategic.

## 🧠 Game Rules

- Two players take turns placing `X` and `O`.
- The board is 3x3, like classic Tic Tac Toe.
- After a player places their **fourth mark**, their **oldest placed mark disappears**.
- The goal is still to get **three of your marks in a row** (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
- The dynamic nature adds a twist: you need to think about which mark will vanish when making your next move.

## 🚀 Features

- Win condition checker
- Dynamic "rolling" mark system
- Win/draw detection
- Scoring Points system
- Simple UI using Windows Forms
